## The five criteria for identifying R&D

- Novel: Aimed at new findings, or improvements
- Creative: Based on original, not obvious, concepts and hypothesis
- Uncertain: Uncertain about the final outcome
- Systematic: Planned and budgeted (time, funds, people, etc.)
- Transferable: Lead to result that could be possibly reproduced
