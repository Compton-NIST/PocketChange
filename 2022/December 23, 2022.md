# NASAâ€™s BEST Engineering Design Model


|||
|---|---|
|ASK|Students identify the problem, requirements that must be met, and constraints that must be considered.|
|IMAGINE|Students brainstorm solutions and research ideas.  They also identify what others have done.|
|PLAN|Students choose two to three of the best ideas from their brainstormed list and sketch possible designs, ultimately choosing a single design to prototype.|
|CREATE|Students build a working model, or prototype, that aligns with design requirements and that is within design constraints.|
|TEST|Students evaluate the solution through testing; they collect and analyze data; they summarize strengths and weaknesses of their design that were revealed during testing.|
|IMPROVE|Based on the results of their tests, students make improvements on their design. They also identify changes they will make and justify their revisions.|
