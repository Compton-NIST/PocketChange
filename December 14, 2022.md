# Agile Research

## "At its core, agile research provides directional guidance early and often to guide decisions that might otherwise be driven by opinion rather than data."

## Summary of Manifestos

- The people are more important than anything we do.  Always.
- We want to start trying to do things without overthinking it.
- We will decide what we are doing as we go.
- We are going to encounter challenges, and we will adapt as we go.

### Potential blind spots to remember:

- We have to know what and where we want to be, even if that changes over time.
- You need to think things through *some*. This isn't about skipping valid concerns. Even firefighters walk.
- Documentation is important to others who will participate and follow later. Just find the balance.
- When we learn the detail, capture the detail.

Based on some decent manifesto points below, some missed points, but things to think about...
